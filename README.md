Sistem Izin Absensi dengan Mongo DB locally dan Node JS

Step to testing:
1. Go to clone this repo
2. Due to exclude node_modules, I suggest to install each dependency according to package.json
4. If Mongo DB doesn't exist, you have to install mongo DB with its server, after install MongoDB, run "mongod"
3. Run "nodemon app" for hot-reloaded running.
4. check web at http://127.0.0.1:3210/ (default)
